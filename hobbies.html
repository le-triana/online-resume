    <h3>Playing Video Games</h3>

    alt="blue and pink hue with a video game controller">
    <p>I'm a bit of a nerd! I grew up watching YouTubers and friends play different
        types of video games: RPG, MMO, co-op, and so on. I am drawn to the virtual
        worlds and the different realities you as the gamer get to explore. One of my
        favorite type of games is open-world story games. Some good examples are
        Horizon Zero and Ghost of Tsushima. These games have breaktaking visuals while 
        also telling gripping tales of growth, battles, looting, and lore.</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>

    alt="a book on someone's lap">
    <p>I've been reading books since I was a lttle girl. I use to read so much that I
        would soemtimes read while my teacher was teaching. And they would yell at me!
        "Stop reading!" Imagine the look on their sheepish grin after telling their
        student not to read. Ironic, isn't it? My favorite genres are psychological 
        thrillers, romance, fantasy, and horror. I'm a bit of a daydreamer, so reading
        a new book is like entering a new world.</p>
    <h3>Anime/Manga</h3>

    alt="hanging anime pictures on a wall">
    <p>If you ever need a recommendation for something to watch or something to read,
        I'm your girl! My favorite genres to watch are psychological thrillers, horror,
        and action. I have a list in my phone of what I've watched/read and what I
        want to watch/read. I feel as though these animes are much more relatable and
        greater depth in the story and characters. I've read a bit of everything, so
        I'm happy to recommend something for a newcomer or a seasoned watcher!
